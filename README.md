# Beyond-Home-Rescale
Rescale config tailored to get the JNSQ feeling and balance in Beyond Home.

The logic:
The native scale of Beyond Home's Rhode has it at a 450km with 50km atmosphere. At 3.5x scale the radius becomes 1575, almost the same as JNSQ's Kerbin.
All planets and orbits get scaled by this factor to create a properly sized system.

That alone doesn't change much about the feel of the homeplanet however. Without further tweaks, orbit and deorbit are still very different from JNSQ.
That's where the homeplanet-specific changes come in: Atmosphere height, temperature, pressure, gravity and visual atmosphere height are all changed to get the feeling just right.
The end result being that achieving orbit of Rhode with this config is really very similar to how it is in JNSQ. Minor differences still apply; this config doesn't change the native temperature and pressure curves, for instance. It just changes the baseline values.

Requirements: Sigma Dimensions.
It WILL work without Beyond Home, but then there isn't much point to this config without it...
